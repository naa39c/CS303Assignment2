Hello, this is Nicolas Aponte's assignment 2. I have properly commented all files involved, explaining what each function does, and allowing the user to change the main.cpp functions to test for cases such as out of index, etc. The first part is labeled with q1, so that you can check those. The part 2 question is labeled under the name of stack, so all relating files are there. Please let me know if any changes are needed, and thank you!
